# ⚠️ Project Terminated

This repository has been cleared due to repeated miscommunication, disrespectful behavior, and a complete lack of professionalism from the client.

Despite my best efforts to understand and deliver the requested work, I was met with rudeness, unclear instructions, and a dismissive tone. This environment made it impossible to continue working constructively.

## A Note to the Client

Professionalism, respect, and clear communication are foundational in any collaboration. Unfortunately, these were not present here. I don’t tolerate disrespect or abuse in any working relationship.

This outcome is the result of how you chose to treat someone who was here to help.

## Conclusion

If you're here trying to understand why this repository is empty — now you know.

I wish you clarity and professionalism in your future collaborations.
